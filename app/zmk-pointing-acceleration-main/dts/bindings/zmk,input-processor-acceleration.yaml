properties:
  input-type:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Input event type to accelerate (e.g. INPUT_EV_REL for relative events)
    
  min-factor:
    type: int
    default: 1000    # 1.000x (no deceleration by default)
    description: Minimum pointer speed factor (scaled by 1000). Values <1000 slow down movements at very low speeds (e.g. 500 for 0.5x).

  max-factor:
    type: int
    default: 3500    # 3.500x
    description: Maximum pointer speed factor (scaled by 1000). Movement will be accelerated up to this factor at high speeds.

  speed-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 1000    # counts per second
    description: Pointer speed (counts per second) at which acceleration factor reaches 1.0 (no scaling). Below this speed, movements may be decelerated; above it, movements accelerate.

  speed-max:
      type: int
      default: 6000    # counts per second
      description: Pointer speed (counts per second) at which the acceleration factor reaches max-factor. Movements faster than this use the maximum acceleration.

  acceleration-exponent:
      type: int
      default: 1       # 1 = linear
      description: Exponent for the acceleration curve. 1 = linear acceleration. 2 or higher applies a more exponential (polynomial) curve for acceleration above the threshold. 

  track-remainders:
    type: boolean
    description: Accumulate and apply fractional movement remainders for higher precision.
